        description: The path to be resolved to an absolute path.
        extendedDescription: >-
          If first path is not absolute, it will be resolved from the process's
          present working directory (`pwd`).
        example: node_modules/sails/bin/sails.js
        required: true
        type: string
      from:
        friendlyName: From
        description: The working directory to resolve from.
        extendedDescription: >-
          If omitted, the result path will be resolved from the process's
          present working directory (`pwd`). If `from` is not absolute, then it
          will first be resolved from the present working directory itself
          before being used to resolve `path`.
