    description: >-
      Get the URL on Spotify that a user should visit to authorize the specified
      Spotify app (i.e. your app).
    parameters:
      clientId:
        example: abc123jdhs3h4js
        description: >-
          The clientId for your Spotify app. The client ID provided to you by
          Spotify when you register your application.
        required: true
        type: string
      redirectUri:
        example: >-
          https://example.com/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ&state=profile%2Factivity
        description: >-
          The URI to redirect to after the user grants/denies permission. This
          URI needs to have been entered in the Redirect URI whitelist that you
          specified when you registered your application.
        required: true
        type: string
      responseType:
        example:
          - code
        description: '(code, token_and_code)'
        type: array
      state:
        example: 34fFs29kd09
        description: >-
          The state can be useful for correlating requests and responses.
          Because your redirect_uri can be guessed, using a state value can
          increase your assurance that an incoming connection is the result of
          an authentication request. If you generate a random string or encode
          the hash of some client state (e.g., a cookie) in this state variable,
          you can validate the response to additionally ensure that the request
          and response originated in the same browser.
        type: string
      scope:
        example: '*'
        description: >-
          A space-separated list of scopes: see Using Scopes. If no scopes are
          specified, authorization will be granted only to access publicly
          available information: that is, only information normally visible in
          the Spotify desktop, web and mobile players. 
        type: string
      dialog:
        example: 'false'
        description: >-
          Whether or not to force the user to approve the app again if theyâ€™ve
          already done so. If false (default), a user who has already approved
          the application may be automatically redirected to the URI specified
          by redirect_uri. If true, the user will not be automatically
          redirected and will have to approve the app again.
