      Prompt the command-line user to check/uncheck items from a list of
      options.
    parameters:
      choices:
        description: >-
          The list of checkboxes- where each choice is a name/value pair
          (dictionary).
        extendedDescription: >-
          The `name` property indicates how the choice will appear in the list. 
          The `value` property is used to report which choice was selected, so
          each `value` should be unique within the list of choices. If `checked`
          is set true, the choice will be pre-selected.  If `disabled` is set to
          a string other than `""`, the user will not be able to select this
          choice, and the string will be displayed to the right of the checkbox.
        example:
          - name: Choice A
            value: some-unique-identifier
            checked: false
            disabled: ''
